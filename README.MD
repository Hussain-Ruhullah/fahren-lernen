# A Chrome Extension that enables keyboard navigation for fahren-lernen.de

As I study for my driving license test in Germany, I realized that learning on the phone for hours had a negative impact on my eyes,
Rather than using my phone, I started learning on fahren-lernen.de web app, 

Despite the fact that there are 1179 questions, each question requires many clicks at different points on the page. 

A well-known German proverb states that "Dumm klickt gut"  
I'm just kidding with the proverb above ;)

As a result, instead of clicking through the driving lessons, I decided to create a Chrome plugin that enables easy keyboard navigation on https://html.fahren-lernen.de. By using this plugin, you will be able to learn more quickly and easily.

Download the extension in google store:

I wish you good luck!
